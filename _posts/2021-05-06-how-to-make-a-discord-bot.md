### Estimated time to complete
**??? hours**

### Introduction
I had an idea one day, stemming from an experience I had at my friend's house involving a bluetooth speaker, Michael Jackson grunting noises (video here), and me being unable to do anything about it. I explain more about that in my video, but let's jump into the tutorial here.

*can I indent this section?*

---
### Goals
There were three main goals with this project:

#### 1. Send audio through to a speaker remotely at all times
To do this, I knew a Raspberry Pi would be the easiest tool to use to interface with my "command center". The command center in this case would be Discord, and the Raspberry Pi would process the commands, turn them into audio, and output that to a speaker.

*add simple drawing of set up here*

I used the DiscordJS module on a NodeJS Docker container running on a Raspberry Pi. The Node app will recognize commands that are received from Discord. The main function of the Node is that send audio files to the Pi from Youtube, but it can also process text to speech.

#### 2. Create an easily deployable app (easy to set up for pranks, easy for others to replicate)
To do this, I knew that I wanted to use Docker. Docker makes it easy for other people to pull your image to their setups and just run it without thinking too much about dependencies and other requirements. You can definitely do this without Docker, but you'd need to install Node locally on the Raspberry Pi, which can be problematic if you want to run other web servers or software on the Pi (but still possible). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to completely contain this project within a Docker container as I couldn't find a way to process the audio files in Node/Docker, but there may be a way to do it -- I think I'm just not experienced enough with Docker yet to figure it out. To get around that, there are some scripts that need to be ran and some software that needs to be installed on the Raspberry Pi locally to make things happen.

#### 3. Not spend too much money
The cost of this project was definitely on the lower side, coming out to around $100 if you don't have all the parts already. The speaker can cost anywhere from $15 to $30 for average speakers. The app in this tutorial was designed to run alongside other processes on a Raspberry Pi, so you could run something like a MagicMirror and this app at the same time if you wanted to (that way, you don't have to buy another Raspberry Pi just to run this).

I only somewhat fulfilled these requirements, but I ended up with an interesting product that might actually have some practical uses apart from the pranking aspect. I've realized that you could also use it like an online jukebox â€” if you have friends over, they could each individually play and queue different songs using this app and without having to download a separate app (assuming people have Discord on their phones). This also means you don't have to use the same phone to queue songs.

It's a relatively simple bot that can definitely be expanded to do more stuff. All I want to show is how to use Discord as a command interface for your Raspberry Pi and some of the potential uses for it as well as expose you to a beginner Docker project. Some of the other uses that I thought of which might be cool to program would be to use Discord as an interface to control lights in your home, receive a security camera recording or photo from a security camera setup, or pull useful performance data (temperatures, CPU usage, storage, etc.) for your servers in your home lab. There's a TON of potential here -- be sure to let me know if you think of anything else that you could see this doing.

### Instructions

**Requirements**

- A computer to connect to the Pi and configure the app
- [Chargeable speaker with 3.5mm jack input](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=speaker+with+3.5mm+audio+input&ref=nb_sb_noss)
  - This is [the speaker that I used](https://www.amazon.com/Enhanced-Splashproof-Portable-Bluetooth-Radiator/dp/B010OYASRG/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=oon+speaker&qid=1621965511&sr=8-3), but it is not the best speaker to use for this project because it turns off automatically if it isn't playing anything. For this project, I recommend using a speaker that does not have an auto shutoff function.
- [3.5mm headphone cable](https://www.amazon.com/Extension-Braided-Zerist-Tangle-Free-Headphones/dp/B07QF1VRPB/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1L2Z9787H0MM0&dchild=1&keywords=3.5mm+audio+cable&qid=1621965534&sprefix=3.5mm+%2Caps%2C238&sr=8-3)
  - Any length will do, but get a longer cable if you don't want the Raspberry Pi to be in the same place as the speaker (i.e., you probably want a longer cable if you want the speaker in a bathroom).
- [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Premium-Clear-Supply/dp/B07BC7BMHY/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi+3+kit&qid=1621965619&sr=8-3) (or 4) setup with Raspbian Buster and ssh enabled (insert video link with timestamp at setup?)
    - MicroUSB power cable (the link above includes a power cable)
    - [Micro SD card](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=32+gb+micro+sd+card&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)
    - Case (the link above includes a case)
- Familiarity with Docker and NodeJS
- Familiarity with bash and javascript
    - I recommend that you know what's happening because it will help a lot, but this tutorial is meant so that even if you know nothing about these technologies that you'll be able to follow along


1. Install Docker
    - If you don't know what Docker is, you should watch this video (insert 60 second docker video).
    - Install Docker on your primary computer: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
      - If you've never used Docker, I **HIGHLY** recommend going through the beginner tutorial. Here are my notes from when I went through the Docker tutorial (insert notes here)
    - Install Docker on the Raspberry Pi: [https://phoenixnap.com/kb/docker-on-raspberry-pi](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/docker-on-raspberry-pi)

2. Set up a Discord bot on your Discord

    (TODO Add content)

3. Pull my Docker container
    - For this tutorial, you can just copy what I have. Make sure that if you share your code with others to strip out any sensitive information, like client tokens. Check out my video or see the sources below if you want to learn more about how everything works up to this point.

        - I've programmed three functions:
            - !tts
                - When you use this command, the app will create a text file, which the Pi will read by which creates an .mp3 file from the text and then the script will play the file.
            - !play
                - When you use this command, the app will download a Youtube video into an .mp3 file, which a script will then play. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out a way to validate input, so if somebody requests a 10 hour video, I think it would overload the Pi and/or crash the app
            - !save
                - When you use this command, the app will download a Youtube video into an .mp3 file, but not play it. This is just if I want to save any Youtube audio, like some songs that are only on Youtube and not available elsewhere.

      - [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
        - Install Node v12+ (Recommended for most users)

      TODO Add more content for how to get to this point??

4. Install dependencies

    (TODO Add content)

5. Pull my scripts to process files

    - These scripts exist on the Raspberry Pi rather than within the Docker container.
    - [This script](insert script) is used to start the Docker container upon reboot.
    - [This script](insert script) is used to monitor a directory for new files created by the app. This will look for .mp3 files created by the !play and !save commands as well as .txt files created by the !tts command and process them accordingly. It will also queue them if people request multiple songs or tts.
    - These scripts will need to be run automatically, so I made them into systemd services to run upon reboot.

    - (TODO Add section for creating systemd services)
    - (TODO Add comments to scripts)

TODO reference files like this [MagicMirror config file](/resources/01-MagicMirror/code/config.js.txt)


### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, this bot is pretty much just for fun and has not much practical usage. I want to expand on it later on though and potentially make it more useful, but I'm pretty happy with it for now. Let me know if you have any ideas for functions for this app and I'll be sure to reply with my thoughts! Hopefully you got something out of this, regardless of the shenanigans.

##### Future enhancements?
- Add command to silence the bot
- Authorize commands based on role in server

Troubleshooting process.. (show google search history images)

- First, I tried to figure out how to make the audio play through the raspberry pi. There was something called omxplayer that gets installed with the raspberry pi base image and I figured this could probably come in handy. (more on this later)
- Then, I tried to figure out how I would get youtube videos/audio to play within the app. I knew that this would require some type of npm package magic, and thankfully there were a few different options. I only had luck with ytdl-core and it worked great for downloading youtube videos.
- Then, I tried to figure out how to play sound from within the docker container. I tried almost any npm package I could find for playing audio but they all didn't seem to work. (LOOK AT ALL OF MY TABS (show video)). I was stuck on this step for hours and my search for a solution spanned days. I kept thinking of ways to rephrase my question but it kept giving me the same or similar results which kept leading me astray. It almost made me want to give up and run the app on the Pi locally instead of within a Docker container, but I knew there had to be a way to do this. It was only when I went back to the start of this all that I realized what I had to do. See, omxplayer is already installed on the raspberry Pi, so if I could figure out a way to call the omxplayer command from within the app container, that would solve my issue. However, since the audio file that gets downloaded from the app is stored within the app, I had to figure out a way to run the omxplayer command from within the app. Somebody on stackoverflow seemed to have the same issue, but the accepted answer didn't really make sense to me and the second answer seemed stupid. It was only when I scrolled down to the third answer that I realized what I needed to do (see video clip).
- The solution was to actually figure out a way to get the video file from the app container and have a different script running on the host machine to look for that file and run the omxplayer command if it saw the file. I thought back to the Docker tutorial and remember named volumes and bindmount volumes and from there the floodgates opened. There is a way to link the host filesystem with the container file system, and you do so by running this command. Then, whatever files get put in the container directory specified in the command also get uploaded to the specified host directory, which enables me to interact with it on the raspberry pi.

docker build -t jftorres/armv7ttsapp . && docker push jftorres/armv7ttsapp

docker pull jftorres/armv7ttsapp

docker run -p 49160:8080 --device /dev/snd -v /home/pi/discordbot/media:/usr/src/app/media -d jftorres/armv7ttsapp

Text to Speech troubles

- I tried to use Python again (tried Python for watchdog), but for a different thing this time. This time, I wanted to make a way to convert text to speech (which was actually the main objective of this project, the other stuff came in later). I first tried using pyttsx3. This was working fine while testing on my Mac, so I copy/pasted the script over to the Pi and built it into the watchdog script... I tested it, and it didn't work. There were no errors, even when I turned on debugging. Which was super helpful. I tried for a couple hours to get it to work and ended up going to the developer's Github to see if there were any known issues with the package and the Raspberry Pi. Based on what I read, I gathered that there were a plethora of issues but not necessarily related to the Pi... there probably is a way to get it to work on the Pi, but I explored alternate methods.
- It turns out one of the components that pyttsx3 is reliant on, an apt package called espeak, can already do text to speech. The problem was that I couldn't get espeak to play the audio from the text to speech. A very special 'Thank you' to all the guides that did **not** mention what to do if you **CAN'T** hear audio when trying to use espeak to play audio. THANK GOD that espeak is able to write to a file, because that way I can use omxplayer to play the .wav file that espeak creates.
- We're back in business.
